Installation notes:

Apache with modpython is required to begin installation. 
Also, desativate Python handler on css, and img directories by setting SetHandler None.

Please make sure that the management openvpn server is active,
if not insert the line above into the openvpn server's config and restart the daemon

management 127.0.0.1 5000 /etc/openvpn/password.txt

the file /etc/openvpn/password.txt contains your favorite password.
to make OpenVPN-Status work you have also to edit the main.py file, and modify the global variables

username:  "your login here"
password:  "your password "
host:      "the ip of the management openvpn server"
port:      "the port of the management openvpn server"
vpnpasswd: "the password of the management openvpn server"


That completes the setup! You can begin viewing your new script, so point your browser to http://your-server/directory/main/

Have fun,
